# Telemetry (on by default)

jshookmcp ships built-in OpenTelemetry instrumentation: it exports **tool-call and search behaviour** over the standard OTLP/HTTP protocol. **On by default** — with zero configuration, data goes to the project maintainer's ingress (minimal content, see the table below; identified only by an anonymous install.id).

To ship to your own backend (a self-hosted [opentelemetry-collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/), SigNoz, Grafana Cloud) or turn it off entirely, use these environment variables.

## Configuration

Set these in `.env` (or the MCP server process environment):

```bash
# Ship to your own backend:
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=<endpoint-url>
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="authorization=Bearer <token>"
# Turn it off entirely (zero network, zero overhead):
JSHOOK_OBSERVABILITY_EXPORTER=none
```

## What is collected (minimal by design)

| Signal | Content | Never includes |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| `tool.execute` span | tool name, domain, duration, success/failure | **tool arguments and response contents are never collected** |
| `search.query` span | query text (see policy below), top-K, result count, latency, BM25 confidence score, vector participation | search result contents |
| `search_feedback_used` metric | rank bucket of the invoked tool (top1/3/5/10) + tool name | — |
| `tool.execute` span arguments | **argument KEY NAMES only by default** (`shape` — keys are already public in the tool schemas; values are never collected). Setting `JSHOOK_OTLP_TOOL_ARGS=truncated/full` opts into values, with credential-ish keys (authorization/cookie/token/secret…) masked as `***` and a total size cap | full argument values are not collected by default |
| Resource identity | `service.name=jshookmcp`, per-process `service.instance.id`, anonymous random install UUID `install.id` | **no hostname, no username, no IP, no machine fingerprint** — install.id is a random UUID generated locally on first run |

## Query text policy (`JSHOOK_OTLP_QUERY_TEXT`)

Search queries can contain your own sensitive material (target URLs, tokens, sample content). The default `truncated` sends only the **first 64 characters** plus an overflow marker:

```bash
JSHOOK_OTLP_QUERY_TEXT=off         # never send query text (numeric stats still flow)
JSHOOK_OTLP_QUERY_TEXT=truncated   # default: first 64 chars + …(+N)
JSHOOK_OTLP_QUERY_TEXT=full        # full text (use only against a private endpoint)
```

## Turning it off

Remove the variables above and the exporter reverts to the default no-op (no network activity). The anonymous install.id lives in `~/.jshookmcp/state/install-id` — delete that file to reset the identity.

Proxied networks: the exporter automatically honors `HTTPS_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY` environment variables (`NO_PROXY` entries and localhost endpoints always connect directly) — no extra configuration needed.

## Other backends

`JSHOOK_OBSERVABILITY_EXPORTER=memory` keeps spans/metrics in process memory (diagnostics); `none` is the default no-op.
