/**
 * Feedback-based vector weight adjustment for tool search.
 *
 * Tracks which tools were selected after searches and adjusts the vector
 * signal weight based on how well the vector ranking predicted the user's
 * choice. The learning rates and "top N" window are configurable via env
 * (see `src/constants.ts`), which lets operators tune convergence speed
 * vs. stability without patching the code.
 *
 * Learning scheme:
 *   - rank < LEARN_TOP_N          → strong up-step (`LEARN_UP`)
 *   - LEARN_TOP_N ≤ rank < 2×N    → weak up-step (30% of `LEARN_UP`)
 *   - rank ≥ 2×N or unseen        → down-step (`LEARN_DOWN`)
 *
 * Bounds: weight ∈ [0.1, 0.8] to guarantee a minimum of lexical + vector
 * blend even in the pessimistic case.
 *
 * Learning can be disabled via `SearchConfig.vectorDynamicWeight` (mirrors
 * the `SEARCH_VECTOR_DYNAMIC_WEIGHT` env default): when false the weight
 * stays at its initial value, which is how the static-model A/B baseline in
 * `scripts/search-tune/compare-static-model.ts` isolates the feedback signal.
 *
 * The learned weight is exportable via `exportSnapshot` so it can outlive a
 * process restart (see the SnapshotSource contract in
 * `src/server/persistence/RuntimeSnapshotScheduler.ts`).
