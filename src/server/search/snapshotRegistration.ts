/**
 * Register a search engine's feedback + quality trackers as snapshot sources.
 *
 * The trackers live inside the ToolSearchEngine instance, which is built lazily
 * by getSearchEngine() only when a search actually runs (see
 * MCPServer.search.helpers). That makes registration inherently conditional:
 * under the stdio transport SEARCH_VECTOR_ENABLED is false and the engine is
 * still constructed on first search, but in profiles that never issue a search
 * the engine never exists and there is nothing to persist — registration is
 * simply skipped.
 *
 * Both trackers implement the SnapshotSource contract
 * (src/server/persistence/RuntimeSnapshotScheduler.ts); the scheduler owns the
 * file I/O (atomic tmp+rename into the state dir). Returns the registered
 * sources so callers (e.g. tests) can assert the wiring.
